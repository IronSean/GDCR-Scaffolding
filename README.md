## GDCR-Scaffolding
Starter projects in various languages for [Global Day of Coderetreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/)

### Motivation

* If a programming pair decide on a given languge (e.g. Groovy), we want a simple project that is ready to go.
* Each project must specify:
    * installation requirements
    * how-to for running tests
* We use `Cell` as a starter class but challenge that assumption: maybe you *don't want* Cell to be a class! It's up to you.
